# Correlation structure
# We'll create a block correlation among (k * p) "variables"
# to mimic "stronger" correlation across tissues, "moderate" across genes.

# 1) Create correlation blocks by tissue
#    Each tissue: p genes with moderate correlation among them
# 2) Then induce correlation across tissues to make it "strong"
#    so that the same gene across different tissues is more highly correlated.

library(MASS)  # for mvrnorm

# Build a block correlation matrix
rho_within_tissue <- 0.4  # moderate correlation within a tissue's genes
rho_across_tissue <- 0.7  # stronger correlation across the same gene in different tissues

  # For each gene g, we find the positions across tissues
  gene_positions <- seq(g, k*p, by=p)
  # Increase correlation among these positions

# We'll pick them randomly, though you can also fix them for reproducibility.

# For demonstration, make them modest in magnitude

# -----------------------------
# Simulation of "Baseline" Expression
# -----------------------------
# We'll sample a baseline multivariate normal vector for each individual (k*p dimension),
# then add the linear age/disease effects.

# The random baseline for all k*p genes in each individual
# We assume mean = 0 for demonstration
baseline_draws <- mvrnorm(n = n, mu = rep(0, k*p), Sigma = Sigma)

# Now create the final expression matrix: X[i, t, g]
# We'll store it as a matrix (n x (k*p)) or an array. Here, a matrix for simplicity:
expression_matrix <- matrix(NA, nrow = n, ncol = k*p)

for(i in seq_len(n)) {
  # linear predictor for each gene-tissue dimension
  linpred <- baseline_draws[i, ] +
    age[i] * age_effects +
    disease[i] * dis_effects
  
  expression_matrix[i, ] <- linpred
}

# Optionally add random measurement noise
# expression_matrix <- expression_matrix + matrix(rnorm(n*k*p, 0, 0.1), n, k*p)

# -----------------------------
# Assemble into a Tidy Structure (Optional)
# -----------------------------
# It's often convenient to put this in a long data.frame
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Let's define a helper that maps column index to tissue & gene
df <- as.data.frame(expression_matrix)
df$id <- seq_len(n)
long_df <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(
    -id,
    names_to = "var",
    values_to = "expr"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    age = age[id],
    disease = disease[id]
  )

# Parse tissue & gene labels from var
long_df <- long_df %>%
  separate(var, into = c("tissue_gene"), sep = "_", remove = FALSE) %>%
  # 'tissue_gene' is like "T1" or "T2" etc. for the label we defined earlier
  separate(tissue_gene, into = c("tissue", "gene"), sep = "G", remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(
    tissue = gsub("T", "", tissue),
    tissue = as.numeric(tissue),
    gene   = as.numeric(gene)
  ) %>%
  select(-var, -tissue_gene)

# Now long_df has columns:
#   id, expr, age, disease, tissue, gene
# This is workable for fitting models.

# -----------------------------
# Demonstration / Analysis
# -----------------------------
# For instance, we might na√Øvely regress expression on age ignoring disease,
# or properly include disease, or compare simple vs. multi-level models, etc.

# Example: Fit a naive linear model ignoring disease for Tissue=1, Gene=1
naive_model <- lm(expr ~ age, data = subset(long_df, tissue == 1 & gene == 1))
summary(naive_model)

# Example: Fit a "true" model including disease
true_model <- lm(expr ~ age + disease, data = subset(long_df, tissue == 1 & gene == 1))
summary(true_model)

# You could compare bias in estimated age coefficients for all genes/tissues
# ignoring vs. including disease or random effects. This helps reveal confounding.


# -----------------------------
# Next Steps
# -----------------------------
# 1) Scale up to realistic k, p (maybe 10+ tissues, 1000+ genes).
# 2) Extend the correlation structure or effect definitions (e.g. factor models).
# 3) Fit multi-level or penalized models to test how well they recover
#    the true age effects when disease is a confounder.
# 4) Evaluate partial correlation, partial R^2, etc. to see how ignoring disease
#    or unobserved confounders biases the "aging" coefficients.
